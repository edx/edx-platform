Plans
#####

Documents in this directory describe work that is in flight, or temporary
infrastructure that is expected to be removed again.

Lifecycle
*********

* **A plan lives exactly as long as the thing it describes.** A plan may ship
  in the same pull request as the work it describes, and is updated there as
  the work progresses. Once the work is finished (or dismantled), delete the
  plan, in the same pull request where practical, otherwise in a follow-up.
* Name the file after its ticket, for example ``LP-1148-ulmo4-upgrade.md``.
  Supporting material for the same ticket (such as an audit) uses the same
  prefix, for example ``LP-1148-ulmo4-merge-audit.md``.
* Link the ticket at the top of the plan. Do not duplicate the plan into the
  ticket or into pull request descriptions: the plan is the single copy.
* Anything expected to outlive its ticket does not belong here. Put decisions in
  ``docs/decisions/`` and durable procedures in ``docs/how-tos/``.

Plans themselves are Markdown, which the Sphinx build ignores; only this README
follows the ``.rst`` convention used elsewhere in ``docs/``. It is marked
``:orphan:`` so it is not expected in any toctree.

Current plans
*************

* ``LP-1148-ulmo4-upgrade.md`` -- landing the ulmo.4+ upgrade (Django 5.2) on
  ``release-ulmo``; ships with the upgrade PR. Delete when the upgrade is in
  production and stable.
* ``LP-1148-ulmo4-merge-audit.md`` -- merge audit of the upgrade branch,
  including the scripts used. Delete together with the plan.
